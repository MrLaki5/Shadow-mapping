#Implementation of shadow mapping technique in OpenGL4 shaders:
* One directional light, which can rotate around the sceen.
* Visible frustum of light source.
* Perspective camera which can zoom in and zoom out scene and rotate around it.
* Shadow acne removed with shadow bias and normal shadow bias value.
* Aliasing of shadows removed with PCF method.
* JOGL, java binding for the OpenGL API used. [Link](http://jogamp.org/ "JOGL")
